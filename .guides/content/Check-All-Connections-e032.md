When dealing with a network device, such as the printer example, always check to ensure the connections are physically secured and none have come loose or been disconnected.

For the printer in the computer lab, this would mean checking the network connection of both the computer and the printer as well as following each network cable to the other end to ensure every connection is in the correct place.
