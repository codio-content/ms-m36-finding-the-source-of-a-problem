If you cannot find any issues from the previous methods, swapping out components can help identify the source of the problem.

Examples of swapping components in the computer lab printer situation are
- Printing from another computer
- Connecting a new printer and printing to it
- Changing out the network cables
- Changing out any other components of the network such as a router

Swap out only one component at a time, so that when the problem is resolved, you will know which component was the source of the problem by which piece is currently swapped out.
